# This file will have the type-checking/validation 
# part of the compiler.  There are a number of things
# that need to be managed to make this work. First,
# you have to have some notion of "type" in your compiler.
# Second, you need to manage environments/scoping in order
# to handle the names of definitions (variables, functions, etc).
#
# A key to this part of the project is going to be test coverage.
# As you add code, think about how to add unit tests.
